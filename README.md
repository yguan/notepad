# Chrome Notepad App

This repository contains the source code of a Chrome App that allows you to manage your notes.

## Development

#### Overview of Folder Structure

`app` Contains the source code for the Website
- `css` CSS files used by the site, but they are generated by the .less files in the `less` folder
- `less` [less](http://lesscss.org/) files for generating CSS files
- `img`  Images
- `js` JavaScripts files and template files
  - `chart` Code to generate charts
  - `data` Data used by the charts or views
  - `extension` Extensions for libraries in the `lib` folder
  - `lib` Libraries
  - `views` Views that render HTML or SVG charts
    - `template` HTML files for appending to the DOM

## Build

To build the package, you have to have `node.js` installed, then in command line console, run the followings steps once:

- go to `portfolio-site` folder
- (if grunt-cli is not installed) run `npm install -g grunt-cli`
- run `npm install`

Now, you can build your project with running `grunt build`. The output folder is `app-built`, you can change it in the `Gruntfile.js` under section `requirejs`.

## Less Files Compilation

`grunt build` compiles all less files to app-min.css. In development, you can run `grunt watch`, and all less files will be compiled in 2 seconds after you change a less file. You can change the delay period `debounceDelay` in `Gruntfile.js` under section `watch`.

## Run the Website locally

If you have [python](http://www.python.org/download/) installed, run the following steps in the command line console:

- go to `app` folder
- run `python -m http.server` (you can specify port number at the end as well, default is 8000)
- go to your browser, and type in the `localhost:8000` to the address bar
- you should see the site running in the browser
